# Away On Vacation
We are given the following audio transcript: "Hello, you’ve reached Iris Stein, head of the HR department! I’m currently away on vacation, please contact my assistant Michel. You can reach out to him at michelangelocorning0490@gmail.com. Have a good day and take care."

I curiously sent an email to the provided gmail address and got the following response:

"Dear,

Thank you for the email, I'm currently away on vacation to celebrate New Years! If you would like a quicker response, feel free to reach out to my social media. I mostly talk about birds on it. 

Have a great start to the year, and take care!"

So, we have to find Michelangelo Corning's social media to get more information. We'll be able to verify its his account if there are birds on it. I immediately took to `Instagram` and searched `Michel Corning` (I figured he would go by a nickname because Iris
called him Michel in the initial transcript.)

That's definitely our guy! Same name and a profile filled with birds. There's no flag in the profile description, so I start to click through the posts. Sure enough, the flag is in one of the post descriptions:

Solved!
